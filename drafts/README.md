# Draft policy modules

This folder is for **non-production modeling drafts**.

- `gavi6-cost-model-draft.js` is a standalone draft of a Gavi 6.0-oriented future-cost model.
- It is **not used by the live website** (`index.html` / `app.js` / `engine.js`) yet.
- Use it as a working area to iterate policy assumptions (country scope caps, phase transitions, and co-financing shares) before integration.
